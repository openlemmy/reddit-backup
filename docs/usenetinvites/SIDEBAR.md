#Welcome!#

Welcome to the usenet invites subreddit. This is a sister reddit to /r/Usenet. Please read over the rules before contributing. We only have a few but they are important.

#Rules#

1. **No pirated content**.

2. This subreddit is **for sharing usenet related invites only.** No account requests/offers, no non-usenet invites.

3. **No trading, buying, or selling.** It is not acceptable to trade, buy, or sell invites.  Please share what you have freely.
 * Posts that contain both an offer and a request for invites will be assumed to suggest a trade.

4. Start ALL titles with -
**[W]** = Wanted
**[O]** = Offering

5. Read the [starting out wiki page](/r/UsenetInvites/wiki/startingout) prior to creating any [W] posts.

6. Indexers in the [No Movement List](/r/UsenetInvites/wiki/nomovement) cannot be offered or wanted.

7. **Don't be a dick.** Read and understand [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). Then read it again.

8. **See rule #1** This is not the place to discuss content that you have illegally obtained or wish to obtain.  We will not tolerate repeat offenders and are ban happy when it comes to this rule.

#Be Careful!#

Please be careful with whom you invite!  Usually invites are linked. If you invite someone, it's because you know them and trust they won't do anything stupid.

Think of invites like a pyramid, if someone at the bottom of your pyramid screws up, and the admins remove that account, it will remove all the accounts that are linked to it.
