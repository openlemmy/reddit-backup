#Welcome to R/Bookclub

-   **How do we pick books?** About halfway through each month, we create a thread for suggestions for the next month's read. Anyone can suggest a book to read (you DON'T have to lead the discussions if you suggest a book - the mods will do that!). The book with the most upvotes is selected for the next month's read. Winners are posted a week or so before the end of the month. Discussion schedules are posted shortly thereafter. Each book is read over the course of a month, typically with one or two check-ins each week posted by a mod.

-   **Can I post about other books?** Most activity is for books selected (by vote) for the current month, but you can post about any [previous selection](/r/bookclub/wiki/previous) anytime.

-   **Don't post about other topics** until you read the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/faq); if you post about a random book **we delete your post**. If you believe your post was removed in error, please contact the mods!

-   We have started a Discord server for additional discussion. Feel free to discuss anything in that server. There are specific channels for the monthly selections as well. [Click here to visit the discord](https://discord.gg/xh2F7Yj)

The selected book of the month will have a schedule _but you don't have to observe the schedule_. Read at your own pace, create new threads at your leisure, and have fun. We only ask, if you are ahead of the schedule, mark your posts with a [Spoilers] tag.

#Spoilers#

If you plan to post spoilers (anything past our current reading point), it might be best to start a new thread about your discussion. Otherwise, please start your comment with [SPOILER]. You may use spoiler tags as well, but they do not always work on mobile. >!SPOILER!< is made by typing > !SPOILER! < without the spaces between characters.
