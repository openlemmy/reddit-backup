#Rules#

##1. Self-promotion and original content

We don't allow:

- Advertisement, solicitation or promotion of any product, company, website or creative endeavour that you own or with which you're affiliated, even if not monetized.

- Referral, affiliate, or discount links/codes.

- Posting comics or art that you made, or that were made/published by anyone affiliated with you.

Occasionally linking to a review you've made on another website is OK if it's not the sole or main content of a post. Doing so in a repetitive manner is not permitted.

##2. Flair your posts

Please help us keep our sub tidy and easy to browse! Use flair! If you have a question on how to flair a post, or what flair to use, please see our guide to flairing at the top of the page, and if you have further questions, please contact the mods.

##3. Pirated content

No pirated content or discussion of how to obtain pirated content. We want to support the artists and creators of this medium. Sharing or requesting pirated content may result in a ban.

##4. Be nice

All posts and comments must conform to [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) and the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Be sure you understand both documents and what they mean about site-wide expectations regarding activity on Reddit.

##5. Stay on topic

This sub is for discussion about graphic novels.

##6. Requests for recommendations

When making a post to request recommendations, be as specific as possible about what you want, for example by specifying a genre and explaining what you already like. If you’re completely new to the medium and want tips for where to start, you could list your favourite novels, films or even video games to give an idea of your tastes.

Posts that just ask for recommendations without any other criteria will be deleted, as will posts with excesively broad requests (e.g. "anything except horror").

##7. Image posts

You're welcome to post photos of hauls or collections, but when making image posts, please include some text explaining why you’re posting. For example, you might want to provide a review of a particular book, some history on your collection and any special highlights, favorites, or why you are particularly excited about a certain book in your new haul. If you can’t think of anything to say, then is it even worth posting? Posts considered low effort may be removed.
